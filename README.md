# Action Quality Assessment of Trampoline Routines
This is the code for my bachelor thesis **Action Quality Assessment of Trampoline Routines**, where I design an AQA framework for the trampoline videos of the [AQA-7 dataset](http://rtis.oit.unlv.edu/datasets.html).

My model is based on the [C3D-LSTM model](https://github.com/ParitoshParmar/C3D-LSTM--PyTorch) by  Parmar and Morris published in the paper ["Action Quality Assessment Across Multiple Actions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06367).

## Pre-trained models
I use pre-trained models with the following weights:
* [C3D weights](https://github.com/DavideA/c3d-pytorch)
* [I3D weights](https://github.com/piergiaj/pytorch-i3d)
* [R(2+1)D weights](https://github.com/moabitcoin/ig65m-pytorch)
